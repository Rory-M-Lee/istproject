        <h1>First Motion Picture Camera & Film (Louis Le Prince)
Louis Le Prince built a single-lens camera and in 1888 used it to make a brief silent movie of people walking in a garden. This was the first true movie camera, and is forgotten mainly because he went missing the year that Edison decided to “invent” the camera. His wife always claimed he had been murdered and in 2008 claims were made that evidence had been found showing Edison's involvement with his assassination.

        <h2> First Motion Picture Camera (Edison) - July 31, 1891
Thomas Edison & assistant William Dickson create the kinetograph, a camera that takes a sequence of pictures to create a sense of motion. Accompanied with his invention of the kinetoscope, a type of film viewer, Edison receives a patent for his film device. Kinetoscope parlors began to open around the United States where customers could view 20 second to one minute long videos for only a nickel. These features many times lacked sound and a storyline.

        <h3>First Use of Additive Color in Film - March 22, 1902
Located merely years ago, the first use of color on film was produced by Edward Raymond Turner from London who captured and colored productions of his children at his home in Hounslow. Later in 1909 he commercialized this method through his patented device called the Kinemacolor. Found by the National Museum in Bradford, the film had been forgotten for 110 years.

        <h4>First Narrative Film - December 1, 1903
"The Great Train Robbery'', a silent film created by Edwin S. Porter, a former cameraman for Thomas Edison, was the first film to have a story line. The feature lasted only ten minutes with a total of only fourteen scenes. Based on a 1896 story by Scott Marble, creators were able to produce a fleeting western based film that introduced parallel editing, camera movement, and location shooting in New Jersey versus the prior stage bound productions.

        <h6>First Feature Film (Multi-Reel) - December 26, 1906
While most films at the time were called "one reel" productions, The Story of the Kelly Gang was the first to use more than one reel. Being a total of six reels long, the film was at the time the longest film at roughly one hour long. Based in Australia, the film showcases scenes of intense gang action that included ‘stick ups’.

        <h10>First Color 3D Film - November 30, 1952
Bwana Devil was the first of the many stereoscopic films to follow in the next few years. It was released in 1952 as the first color 3D film. Combining color and 3D was used to attract more viewers for 3D films. The year between 1950 and 1955 recorded the highest number of 3D movies being produced since the birth of this technology. This record was broken starting in 2009 and onwards. Around 1955, towards the end of the first golden age, the excitement with 3D was getting lost. The main reason for this was that the film had to be shown on two reels simultaneously for it to be seen in 3D.
